# My Personal Website

## Setup

In order to run locally you need to have `npm` and `serve` installed globally or locally.

Install `serve` globally with `npm`

```bash
sudo npm install -g serve
```

Run server

```bash
npm run serve
```

After the above command you should get 2 URLs like the following

<img
    src="https://i.ibb.co/c8Y38RD/serve.png"
    alt="Running on Mac"
    class ="center"
    style="
        .center {
            display: block;
            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
            width: 50%;}">

And you can check the website on a browser with any of the two URLs you obtained.
